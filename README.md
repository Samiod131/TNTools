# TNTools
An old collection of tools for solving classical and quantum problems with Tensor Networks, with a focus on combinatorial optimization.

This is beginning to date and shows how my code came to improve over the years.  


### Further potential improvements

-Split in clean submodules
-Add proper docstring
-Implement JIT compilation
-Unit tests
